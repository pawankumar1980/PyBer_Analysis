# PyBer_Analysis

Pyber with Matplotlib

## **Background**

After completing a successful exploratory analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing business, the CEO asked the Manager and me to deep dive into the data to understand ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. The scope of work includes using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlb to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type.

## **Results**

### **Summary DataFrame**

The two data frames were merged, and the groupby() function was used to calculate the total number of rides, drivers, and fares for each city type. In addition, the average fare per ride and fare per driver for each city was calculated. In addition, the average fare per ride and fare per driver for each city was calculated. Finally, this data was added to a summary data frame.
